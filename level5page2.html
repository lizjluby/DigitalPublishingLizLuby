    <h1>We will sing of great crowds excited by work, by pleasure, and by riot;</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>we will sing of the multicolored, polyphonic tides of revolution in the modern capitals; </h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>we will sing of the vibrant nightly fervor of arsenals and shipyards blazing with violent electric moons;</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>greedy railway stations that devour smoke-plumed serpents; factories hung on clouds by the crooked lines of their smoke; bridges that stride the rivers like giant gymnasts, </h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h5>flashing in the sun with a glitter of knives; adventurous steamers that sniff the horizon; deep-chested locomotives whose wheels paw the tracks like the hooves of enormous steel horses bridled by tubing; </h5>
    <h6><em>and the sleek flight of planes whose propellers chatter in the wind like banners and seem to cheer like an enthusiastic <a href="level5page3.html">crowd.</a></em></h6>
